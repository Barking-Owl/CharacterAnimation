# CharacterAnimation
 
 A short animation test of a character with the help of free assets drawn from the Unity Store to provide armature and animator. Nonetheless, the idle, walk, jump start, in the air, and end of jump animation (one of them - it is a blend tree) are animated by BarkingOwl/Lavender Florence, as well as Vivian's model itself.
